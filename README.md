# IDEK-Mixin-Tweaks

A small mod intended for tweaking things about Reika's Dragon Realm pack that cannot otherwise be tweaked.

Specifically created to fix the bug in Chromaticraft V33a where block updates next to adjacency cores always cause a server crash.

To compile, you must place `ChromatiCraft 1.7.10 V33a.jar` in the `libs/` directory.
